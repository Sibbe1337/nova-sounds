# JavaScript Errors Fixed

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Null Reference Errors in enhanced.html**
   - Added null checks for elements before attempting to access them
   - Fixed `getElementById` calls to handle cases when elements don't exist
   - Added fallbacks when setting properties or innerHTML on potentially null elements
   - Fixed inconsistent variable naming (currentStyle vs selectedStyle)

2. **HTTP 500 Error on '/proxy/styles' Request**
   - Modified the UI server's proxy_styles endpoint to return fallback styles instead of a 500 error
   - This ensures the UI can continue to function even when the API server is unavailable

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added detailed error logs to help diagnose issues
   - Implemented graceful degradation when external resources aren't available
   - Added appropriate fallback values when expected data is missing

## Key Files Modified

1. **src/ui/main.py**
   - Updated the `/proxy/styles` endpoint to provide fallback styles when the API isn't available

2. **templates/enhanced.html**
   - Fixed multiple querySelector and element access issues with proper null checking
   - Added defensive programming practices to prevent JavaScript errors
   - Improved error handling in fetch operations

## How to Run the Fixed Application

1. Start the API server:
   ```
   python debug_api.py
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the UI server:
   ```
   python debug_ui.py
   ```

3. Access the application at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8091
   ```

The application should now run without JavaScript errors even if some components are unavailable or the API server can't be reached.
