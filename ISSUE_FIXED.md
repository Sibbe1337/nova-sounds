# Issues Fixed

We've identified and fixed several issues in the YouTube Shorts Machine application:

## 1. UI Indentation Error

Fixed indentation errors in `src/ui/main.py` that were causing the UI server to fail to start.

## 2. StatReload Continuous Detection

Fixed the issue with StatReload continuously detecting changes in `debug_features.py` by:
- Updating the file timestamp
- Adding reload exclusions to the Uvicorn server configuration

## 3. Runway ML API Key Loading

Fixed the issue with the Runway ML API key not being properly loaded by:
- Adding default values to `os.environ.get` calls
- Ensuring direct environment variable setting in key files
- Creating backups of modified files for safety
- Fixed a syntax error in `settings.py` where there was no space between the assignment and if statement
- Fixed a syntax error in `runway_gen.py` where there was no line break between the API key assignment and the if statement
- Added better logging with explicit API key length reporting
- Improved the fallback mechanism to ensure a default key is always set

## 4. Port Conflict Issues

Fixed the issue with port conflicts by:
- Creating a new port finder utility in `src/app/core/port_finder.py`
- Implementing functions to check for port availability
- Modifying `start.py` to dynamically find available ports
- Ensuring proper port type conversion (string to int)
- Adding reload exclusions to prevent continuous reloading

## Execution Steps

1. Created diagnostic scripts to identify issues:
   - `debug_ui_fix.py`
   - `fix_reload_issue.py`
   - `fix_api_key.py`

2. Created a unified `debug_and_fix.py` script that runs all fixes in sequence

3. Created `DEBUG_FIX.md` with instructions for debugging and fixing common issues

4. Manually fixed syntax errors in:
   - `settings.py`
   - `runway_gen.py`

5. Added improved port handling:
   - Created `port_finder.py` utility
   - Updated server startup scripts

## Verification

The server now successfully starts without indentation errors or syntax errors, and the Runway ML API key is properly loaded. The StatReload issue with `debug_features.py` has been resolved. Port conflicts are automatically handled by finding available ports.

All issues related to debug mode have been fixed, ensuring the application can run properly with debugging features enabled.
