# Fixed Setup Instructions

## Issues Fixed

1. **Syntax error in `trends.py`**
   - The file had an incomplete function call where it was returning `analyzer` without completing the method call
   - Fixed by completing the method call to `analyzer.get_preset_trends(days=days)`
   - Also added error handling and implemented the other required API endpoints

2. **App initialization problem in `__init__.py`**
   - The file was trying to use `app` before it was defined
   - Fixed by creating the FastAPI app at the beginning of the file
   - Added proper imports for CORS and configuration
   - Moved all router includes to `__init__.py` for better organization

3. **Redundant app initialization in `main.py`**
   - Updated to import the app from `__init__.py` instead of creating a new one
   - Removed redundant router includes

## Running the Application

For debugging purposes, we've created separate scripts to run the API and UI servers:

### API Server

```bash
python debug_api.py
```

This starts the API server on http://localhost:8090

### UI Server

```bash
python debug_ui.py
```

This starts the UI server on http://localhost:8091

## Regular Startup

The main `start.py` script should now work correctly. Run it with:

```bash
python start.py
```

This will start both API and UI servers on ports 8080 and 8081 respectively.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter port conflicts:
1. Check for running processes using the ports: `lsof -i :[port]`
2. Kill any existing processes: `kill [PID]`
3. Alternatively, edit the script to use different ports

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/trends.py` - Fixed syntax error
2. `src/app/api/__init__.py` - Added app initialization
3. `src/app/api/main.py` - Updated to import app from __init__
4. Added debug_api.py and debug_ui.py for easier debugging
