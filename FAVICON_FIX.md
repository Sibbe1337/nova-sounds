# Favicon Fix

## Issue
The application was generating 404 errors for favicon.ico because the file didn't exist and there was no route handler for it.

## Files Added
1. **src/ui/static/favicon.ico** - A new ICO format favicon
2. **static/favicon.ico** - Copy of the same favicon in the root static directory

## Files Modified
1. **templates/base.html** - Added links to the favicon.ico file:
   ```html
   <link rel="icon" href="/static/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
   <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/static/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
   ```

2. **src/ui/main.py** - Added a route handler for the favicon.ico file:
   ```python
   @app.get("/favicon.ico", include_in_schema=False)
   async def favicon():
       """Serve favicon.ico from static directory."""
       return FileResponse("src/ui/static/favicon.ico")
   ```

## Implementation Method
The favicon was created programmatically to match the existing favicon.svg design (blue rounded rectangle with a play button icon), containing both 16×16 and 32×32 pixel versions for compatibility with different browsers and platforms.

## Benefits
1. Eliminates the 404 errors for favicon.ico
2. Provides proper favicon display for browsers that don't support SVG favicons
3. Shows the site icon in browser tabs, bookmarks, and history

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Start the API server: `python debug_api.py`
2. Start the UI server: `python debug_ui.py`
3. Open http://localhost:8091 in your browser
4. Check browser dev tools - there should be no 404 errors for favicon.ico
